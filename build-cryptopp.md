Building Crypto++ on Linux
==========================

Install the dependencies

$ sudo apt-get install unzip

Set up the development folder by downloading the Crypto++ 5.6.2 source

$ mkdir cryptopp

$ cd cryptopp

$ wget http://www.cryptopp.com/cryptopp562.zip

$ unzip -a cryptopp562.zip

Uncomment the line "CXXFLAGS += -fPIC", by removing the preceeding #, inside GNUmakefile and build the library

$ make static dynamic test

Install it on your system

$ sudo make install

Troubleshooting:
----------------

If you have issues with an "Illegal instruction" error, as we experienced on one test machine, modify GNUmakefile and set the line "CXXFLAGS += -march=native" to "CXXFLAGS += "
